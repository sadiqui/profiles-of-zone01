<h2 align="center">GraphQL thingy</h2>

This project is made by **[Sadiqui](https://github.com/sadiqui)** (yes, me ðŸ‘€). It's like... a personal profile thing? But fancy! Uses **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)** (cool name), and pulls stuff about the user (**[Zoner](https://zone01oujda.ma/)**). Then it throws it on the screen with some colors and like... graphs? SVG ones. They wiggle. You log in, see your stats, XP and stuff. Oh and JWT because, security I guess?

## It does stuff

### Logging in and out things

- user goes in (name + pass). Checks it, if wrong: nope
- valid ones get a token (JWT). logout? yup, thatâ€™s there

### Data on the page (the cool bits)

- some stats (audit something, level things)
- more info? shiny skill donut & XP timeline

### You can even see it live

Itâ€™s on GitHub pages somewhere (probably) â€“ check it... maybe?
