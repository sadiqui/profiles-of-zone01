[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d8fc3fb5-5691-4d2e-8fa2-ae5d043f517f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/graphql-01/deploys)

This GraphQL thingy was made by **[Sadiqui](https://github.com/sadiqui)** (yes, me ðŸ‘€). It's like... a personal profile thing? But fancy! Uses **[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)** (cool name), and pulls stuff about the user (**[Zoner](https://zone01oujda.ma/)**). Then it throws it on the screen with some colors and like... graphs? **[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG)** ones. They wiggle. You log in, see your stats, XP and stuff. Oh and **[JWT](https://jwt.io/)** because, security I guess?
